**I am now applying for a Ph.D. program to further my research. My research interest includes Biometrics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning.** I recently completed my Master's degree at South China University of Technology, where I was supervised by **[Prof. Wenxiong Kang](https://www.scholat.com/auwxkang)** and **[Prof. Junduan Huang](https://www.scholat.com/junduanhuang)**, focusing on **biometrics, computer vision, and deep learning**. Moreover, I received my Bachelor's Degree from South China University of Technology in Automation in 2021. During my undergraduate years, I focused on intelligent devices at the edge under the guidance of **[Dr. Xiaoyan Deng](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086300159)**.


I have published 2 papers at the IEEE Transactions.<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GYHA_S8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
