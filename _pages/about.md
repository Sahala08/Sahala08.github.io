I am now in the process of applying for a Ph.D. program to further my research in [‰Ω†ÁöÑÁ†îÁ©∂È¢ÜÂüü]. I recently completed my Master‚Äôs degree at South China University of Technology, where I was supervised by Prof. Wenxiong Kang and Prof. Junduan Huang, focusing on biometrics, computer vision, and deep learning during my studies. Moreover, I received my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree from South China University of Technology in Automation in 2021. During my undergraduate years, I focused on intelligent devices at the edge under the guidance of Dr. Xiaoyan Deng. Additionally, I studied mathematical modeling under the supervision of Prof. Weijian Ding.

My research interest includes Biometrics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning.
I have published more than 2 papers at the top AI Trans with total google scholar citations <img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
